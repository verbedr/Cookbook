# Cookbook
This is a tempalte or cookbook project used to make other projects and to try out ideas

## TODO

### Functional

1. Add menues
2. Add alternative products to a ingredient (need to have the corrective ratio)
3. Print shopping list ...
4. Combine or split recipe steps => goal is that cooks can add their custom habbits to the process and share.
5. Add nutrion/alergic information to ingredients (or to products)
6. Add weekplanner

### Technical

1. Add unit tests to verify the handlers to service interface ratio/existing.
2. Add wcf integration case for customers with two dmz zones. (WCF is contract based and more stable as an internal integration platform?)
